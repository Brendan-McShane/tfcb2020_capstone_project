Dataset is the glaucoma set used for machine learning; see bottom for citation. There are 3 .csv files where 2 are subsets of the other that were 
used for the machine learning portion of the original paper.I renamed the variables in ds_whole.csv to be more descriptive biologically.

Questions:

1) Are the continuous variables within the total data normally distributed? If not, are they normally distributed within disease state? 

	Making a scatter matrix of the continuous variables should answer these questions.

2) Which continuous variables are the most correlated?
	
	
	
3) After PCA, how many dimensions are necessary to account for at least 95% of the variance within the data?

	Do PCA and see.
